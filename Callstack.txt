=========CALL STACK===========
Call stack represents the basic execution of functions inside JAVASCRIPT
=====refering to pic2.png========
=>break points are added to the one(),two(),three()
=>hence call stack follows last in first out methode
==explanation==
=>let us consider when we call one(),two(),three()
in this case execution happens in this way one()=>two()=>three()
=>But what if in function one we are calling function two and inside function two we are calling function three
=>hence when function one will stay in callstack till the function two gets removed from stack and function two stays
till the function three stays in stack.
