========JAVASCRIPT CODE EXECUTION=============
Javascript executes the code in three different phases.

1) Global Execution context
In Global execution context by default this keyword is allocated

2) Memory Creation phase
In memory phase memory is allocated to each variable.
=====refering to pic1.png========
initially val1=undefined, val2=undefined, addnum=definition,
result1=undefined, result2=undefined
Though the values are assigned to val1 val2 but in memory allocation phase the variables will be indefined

3) Execution phase
In execution phase all the operations are performed and results are returned.
After the execution thread is deleted.
=====refering to pic1.png========
val1=10
val2=5
addnum=addnum has one variable declared inside it hence new environment and execution thread is created.
=====inside addnum=======
hence it goes to memory creation phase=>total=undefined,val1=undefined,val2=undefined
then it comes to executionphase=>val1=10,val2=5,total=15
execution thread is deleted and total is assigned to the global execution context
